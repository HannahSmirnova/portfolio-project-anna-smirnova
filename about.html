            I am a creative and empathetic professional with a strong foundation
            in business logic and user-oriented problem-solving. Passionate
            about intuitive design, visual storytelling, and building user
            experiences that are both thoughtful and accessible. My background
            spans agriculture, administration, marketing, and lending support ‚Äî
            giving me deep insight into how real people interact with systems. I
            have been studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, visual concept design,
            motion graphics, and have successfully supported small businesses
            and startups through strategic design and digital marketing. Rooted
            in both analytical structure and creative exploration, I am seeking
            opportunities to co-create products that truly work for people ‚Äî and
            feel good to use.
